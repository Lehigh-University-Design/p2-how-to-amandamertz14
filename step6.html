        <h2>Weeds</h2>
        <p>Mulch is a great way to advert weeds from sprouting. Covering your soil with a layer of mulch, prevents weeds from getting the sunlight they need to sprout, it also locks moisture into the soil to prevent it from drying out. Weed killer supplements are also an option, but they arenâ€™t as natural and risk killing your plants as well.

            <h2>Animals</h2>
            <p> Fences are the best method to animals away from your plants, however to make fences effective they must be at least 8 feet tall.  Wire plant covers are the next best protection. They act as a protective dome over your plants and make it impossible for animals to eat them.</p>
