        <h2>Buying</h2>
        <p>For beginners, it’s recommended to buy plants pre-potted, but you can also buy seeds (see materials).</p>

        <h2>Hardening Off</h2>
        <p>If you buy pre-potted plants, it’s important to harden them off. Most pre-potted plants are grown and conditioned to an inside environment. “Hardening off” is the process in which you gradually acclimate pre-potted plants to outside conditions. The process takes 12 days.</p>

            <h2>12 Day Process</h2>
            <p>Once you buy your pre-potted plants, 
                <br>Place them outside in direct sunlight for an hour then bring them inside</br>
                <br> The next day, leave them outside for two hours and then bring them inside</br>
                <br>Increment the hours each day until the plants can last a full 12 hours outside
                water plants once a day</br>
