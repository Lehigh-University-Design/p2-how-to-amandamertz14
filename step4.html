        <h2>Raised</h2>
            <p>Raised gardens can be built anywhere and host a number of plants, they are best for beginners. These gardens are great for soil control: you can ensure ground dirt doesnâ€™t interfere with your soil and you can place several different types of soils in a controlled manner. Above ground gardens develop less weeds but are still susceptible to animals. </p>
